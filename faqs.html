      <h2>Scope of the List (from fasola.org)</h2>
      <p>
        The <i>discussions</i> list focuses on historical and technical aspects
        of shape-note singing. Examples of topics include tunebook history,
        shape note pedagogy, musicological analysis, as well as reviews of
        books, recordings, articles, and conferences.
      </p>

      <h2>Unsubscribing from Fasola-Discussions</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Unsubscribing using email</i>. To unsubscribe using email send a
        blank a message to
        <a href="mailto:fasola-discussions+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com"
          >fasola-discussions+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com</a
        >. Note: it is very important that your unsubscribe message MUST be sent
        from the SAME EMAIL ADDRESS you are unsubscribing. That is, you can only
        unsubscribe your own address. If you have more than one email account,
        be sure you are logged on to the right one. If the account has been
        deleted, you'll need help from the moderator.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Unsubscribing using Google</i>. If you have a Google account, it is
        very easy to manage your subscription at the website. Go to the
        Fasola-Discussions homepage at
        <a
          href="http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions</a
        >. Login to Google and click the link "Edit my membership" on the right
        side of the page. You should see an unsubscribe button along with other
        subscription options.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you send a message to the moderator asking for help unsubscribing,
        you should include your email address in the message. The moderator will
        look up the address in the subscriber list and unsubscribe you.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you still receive messages after unsubscribing, be aware that there
        are two fasola lists: fasola-discussions and fasola-singings. Make sure
        the messages you don't want to receive say "[fasola-discussions]" and
        not "[fasola-singings]" in the subject line.
      </p>

      <h2>Message Archive</h2>
      <p>
        The Fasola-Discussions email list is managed by Google Groups. You can
        view the message archive at the Fasola-Discussions homepage at
        <a
          href="http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Fasola-Discussions is a Public List</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone can view the messages posted to Fasola-Discussions. Only
        subscribers may post to the list, however. Fasola-Singings, in contrast,
        is a private list where only subscribers can view messages.
      </p>

      <h2>Replying to a Post</h2>
      <p>
        The message settings on Fasola-Discussions are set to Reply-To-Sender
        (as opposed to Reply-To-Group). So if you use the Reply button on your
        mail client, only the sender will receive the message. This is to
        prevent inadvertent posts to the list. To reply to the list, use
        Reply-All and the list address will appear in the message header. Or you
        can type or paste the list address manually,
        "fasola-discussions@googlegroups.com".
      </p>

      <h2>Managing Your Subscription Using Google Groups</h2>
      <p>
        Fasola-Discussions is operated through Google Groups. It is not
        necessary to have a Google account, but if you do have one you may use
        their subscription interface. If you go to the Fasola-Discussions
        homepage at
        <a
          href="http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions</a
        >
        you will see the login button at the top right corner of the screen. If
        you are already logged in, your username will be displayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you subscribe to Fasola-Discussions, the default subscription type
        is to send each message separately to your mailbox. If you have a Google
        account you may change this to any of four subscription types. Go to the
        Fasola-Discussions homepage at
        <a
          href="http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >http://groups.google.com/group/fasola-discussions</a
        >, login to Google, and click the "Edit my membership" link to the
        right. You will see a menu "How do you want to read this group?" with
        four choices:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>No Email (I will read this group on the web)</li>
        <li>Abridged Email (Once per day or for every 100 messages)</li>
        <li>Digest Email (Approximately 1 email per day)</li>
        <li>Email (Send each message to me as it arrives)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Code of Conduct: Fasola Discussions</h2>

      <h3>1. Purpose and Scope</h3>
      <p>
        The Fasola Discussions group exists to facilitate high-quality
        conversations regarding the historical and technical aspects of
        shape-note singing. We welcome singers, scholars, and enthusiasts to
        discuss:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tunebook history and bibliography</li>
        <li>Shape-note pedagogy and singing schools</li>
        <li>Musicological analysis of tunes and texts</li>
        <li>
          Discussions of relevant books, recordings, articles, and conferences
        </li>
        <li>Other topics of general historical and technical interest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While we are a community of friends and singers, this list is
        specifically reserved for the topics above. General community
        announcements, strictly social chatter, or discussions about current
        Sacred Harp politics/governance are better suited for other venues.
        Singing announcements can be made to the Fasola Singings Google Group.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Expected Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to maintain a welcoming and intellectually stimulating
        environment. Members are expected to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Be Civil and Respectful:</strong> Disagreements are natural
          and encouraged, but they must remain professional. Attack the
          argument, not the person.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay On-Topic:</strong> Ensure your posts relate directly to
          shape-note history, theory, or practice. If you are unsure if a topic
          fits, ask yourself: Does this contribute to our technical or
          historical understanding of the tradition?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cite Sources When Possible:</strong> As this is a technical
          list, referencing your sources (tunebook editions, page numbers,
          historical documents) helps elevate the conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assumption of Good Faith:</strong> Assume that the other
          members of the discussion are acting in good faith, and extend grace
          to them and to the moderators.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        The following behaviors will not be tolerated and may result in
        moderation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Attacks and Harassment:</strong> Bullying, insults,
          or ad hominem attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Off-Topic Debates:</strong> Discussions concerning modern
          partisan politics, religion (outside of its historical context in the
          music), or commercial promotion unrelated to the genre.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spam:</strong> Unsolicited advertisements or unrelated
          content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Moderation Policy</h3>
      <p>
        This group is currently moderated by John Bealle and Will Fitzgerald. As
        fellow singers and volunteers, we aim to moderate with a light touch,
        but we reserve the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Warn members who violate the code of conduct.</li>
        <li>
          Delete posts that are offensive, spam, or significantly off-topic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove members who persistently violate these guidelines or disrupt
          the community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have a concern about a post or a thread, please contact the
        moderators directly off-list rather than engaging in a public dispute.
        Currently, all posts are reviewed before posting.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Copyright and Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        Please respect copyright laws when posting lyrics, sheet music, or
        audio. Brief excerpts for the purpose of analysis are generally
        acceptable (fair use), but please avoid posting entire copyrighted works
        without permission.
